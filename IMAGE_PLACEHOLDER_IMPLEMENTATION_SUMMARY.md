### 2. Hero Background Image (HeroSection Component)
**Updated in:** `src/components/astro/HeroSection.astro`

- **Hero Background**: `/hero/construction-site-dubai-background.jpg` (1920x1080px)
  - Alt text: "Dubai construction site background showing modern buildings under construction with cranes and construction equipment, representing ServDubai's construction finishing expertise"
  - Implemented with proper fallback gradient background
  - Added error handling for image loading

### 3. Team Images (Site Configuration)
**Updated in:** `src/config/site.ts`

- **Project Manager**: `/team/construction-site-manager.jpg` (1000x600px)
